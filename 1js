Hi @Raja Patibandla, good morning.
I’m from Kapil’s team. The mfe-account dit1 deployment is failing continuously due to an artifact issue.
@Smita Gupta suggested checking the mfe-shop Dockerfile and updating the mfe-account Dockerfile accordingly.
Could you please confirm if I can proceed with updating the mfe-account Dockerfile in the same way to resolve this artifact issue?
