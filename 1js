Hi Lipishree,

We are part of the Alpha team and currently working on the following repositories:
	•	onevz-value-digital-mfe-account
	•	onevz-value-digital-soe-account-service

The request is related to merging NSA code changes during offshore hours, as currently only Mahesh has access to merge NSA PRs. Having offshore support will help us avoid delays and dependency on onsite hours.

Please let us know if you need any additional details on the feature or access requirements.
