Hi Mahesh,

Actually, Saikumar is correct. The JSON I provided is not what I’m getting from the service after your code deployment. It looks similar to the ST/TF issue, where the navigation buttons are missing. Also, in the footer, I’m getting extra elements that are not present in the JSON templates I had shared earlier.
