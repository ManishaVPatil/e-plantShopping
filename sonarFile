   Hi Team,

Please clear the cache for the mfe-account on the TST environment. We are facing an issue that was not observed in the lower environments (SIT2 and SIT1).

When the URL is loaded, a blank page appears and the console shows a “chunk failed” error message. However, if we reload the page, the UI loads correctly.

Kindly look into this and help resolve the issue.
